👋🏻 Hi, I’m Didem Gedik

👀 On my GitHub, you'll find projects showcasing my work with frontend (React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript), mobile (React Native), and backend technologies (Node.js). I strive to build user-friendly, performance-oriented applications with clean, maintainable code.

🌱 I am currently learning full-stack development and mobile development.

I'm excited to continue growing and contributing to the open-source community. Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you'd like to connect!

📫 How to reach me: didemgedik91@gmail.com
